					<div class="praiseQuote"><p>"Brooke Axtell is an incredibly gifted writer and editor. If you are looking to make your ideas and words sing, 
						Brooke is your woman. She consistently strives to understand the messaging you are endeavoring to deliver and then,
						like a magician, takes your thoughts and makes them even 'more you.' I've had the great pleasure of working with Brooke 
						on a number of projects and she is dedicated, hard-working, honest, trust- worthy... and mind-bogglingly creative. 
						Oh - and she's a delightful human being on top of it all. Highly recommend!"

				<div class="praiseQuote"><p>"Brooke gave me some much needed reflection and feedback about two chapters of my manuscript. 
					She listened deeply to what I needed and in an efficient and timely manner, came back with her comments and insights
					about the chapters that helped toboth strengthen them and give them deeper clarity. I have and will recommend Brooke
					in a heartbeat to any writer looking for a brilliant, creative, and wise woman to serve as a sounding board for her work.
					I was entirely satisfied and impressed with her work. She's also just a flat out amazing person. 
					Highest number of stars and shout-outs from me"

	<div class="praiseQuote"><p>"The publishing world isn't the same as it was five years ago -- things are changing, and quickly. 
		Authors need representation that reflects this dynamic new time in media we're in. Rather than following a vague outdated PR model, 
		Brooke Axtell has a fresh and proactive approach to artist representation. She outlined very specific target media opportunities 
		for me, discussed them with me and delivered. She's not just getting you a review here, a shout out there, she's helping you build
		your own relationships with like-minded individuals, and really, the returns on relationships in this business are infinite.
		I couldn't recommend her more highly."
